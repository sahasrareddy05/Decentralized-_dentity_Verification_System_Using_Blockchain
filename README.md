# Decentralized_Identity_Verification_System_Using_Blockchain


Our project focuses on replacing old, insecure identity systems with a decentralized model that uses Blockchain and IPFS. Instead of storing identity documents on a central server that can be hacked or misused, we store them safely in IPFS, which is a distributed storage system. Only the document’s hash—a unique digital signature—is saved on the blockchain. Once information is stored this way, it cannot be changed or tampered with, ensuring complete trust and authenticity. This approach protects the user’s privacy because the actual documents are not exposed on the blockchain.
